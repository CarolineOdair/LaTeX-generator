# LaTeX-generator

LaTeX-generator was created to speed up the process of writing LaTeX documents with large amount of images which are quite annoying to include in LaTeX. This app allows user to generate TeX templates with images added in bulk. Itâ€™s done by placing image files into a special directory. Script looks at the directory and includes all images following certain naming pattern into a TeX file.
